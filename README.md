# Scientific challenges and directions

We present a novel resource to help scientists and medical professionals discover challenges and potential directions across scientific literature, focusing on a broad corpus pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic and related historical research. This repository contains models and datasets described in our paper: [A Search Engine for Discovery of Biomedical Challenges and Directions]().

* Please cite our paper if you use our datasets or models in your project. See the [BibTeX](#citation).

## Annotated datasets and model
The train, test, and val csvs are can be downloaded from our repository directly.
You can download a pre-trained model from [here](https://challenges-directions.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Multilabel_ProblemDirection.pth
). 
## Example notebook
We include an example notebook that uses the model for inference. See `Inference_Notebook.ipynb`.
